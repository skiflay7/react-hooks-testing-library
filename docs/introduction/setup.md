# Setup

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) which is bundled with [node](https://nodejs.org) and
should be installed as one of your project's `devDependencies`:

```sh
npm install --save-dev react-hooks-testing-library
```

## Testing Framework

In order to run tests, you will probably want to be using a test framework. If you have not already got one, we recommend using [jest](https://jestjs.io/), but this library should work without issues with any of the alternatives.
